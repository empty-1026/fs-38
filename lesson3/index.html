      <p>
        The AK-47, officially known as the Avtomat Kalashnikova (Russian:
        –ê–≤—Ç–æ–º–∞—Ç –ö–∞–ª–∞—à–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞, lit. 'Kalashnikov's automatic rifle'; also known as
        the Kalashnikov or just AK), is an assault rifle that is chambered for
        the 7.62√ó39mm cartridge. Developed in the Soviet Union by Russian
        small-arms designer Mikhail Kalashnikov, it is the originating firearm
        of the Kalashnikov (or "AK") family of rifles. After more than seven
        decades since its creation, the AK-47 model and its variants remain one
        of the most popular and widely used firearms in the world.

            Pulemyot Kalashnikova, English: "Kalashnikov's hand-held machine gun"),
            sometimes inaccurately termed the RPK-47, is a Soviet 7.62√ó39mm light
            machine gun that was developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov in the early
            1960s, in parallel with the AKM assault rifle. It was created to
            standardize the small arms inventory of the Soviet Army, where it
            replaced the 7.62√ó39mm RPD machine gun. The RPK continues to be used by
            the military of the post-Soviet states and certain African and Asian
        nations. The RPK is also manufactured in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and
        Serbia.
